          I'm <span> Yashvanth </span>, a final-year student pursuing B.E in CSE from Bengaluru, India.

I focus on delivering seamless user experiences and compelling visuals that communicate effectively.
          <br/> <br/>
          Proficient in industry-standard tools like<span> Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Canva,</span> I can create designs that not only look great but are also user-centric and functional. Beyond design, Iâ€™m always open to learning and exploring new trends in the design and technology landscape. Let's collaborate and create impactful digital experiences together!
