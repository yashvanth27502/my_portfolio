The UI design of this website is inspired by the [portfolio](https://hamishw.com/) of Hamish Walton. While the base structure was drawn from his portfolio, I have innovatively customized and revamped the layout to reflect my personal style and give it a unique appearance. My heartfelt gratitude to [`Hamish Walton`](https://github.com/HamishMW) for the creative inspiration that has contributed to this unique presentation.
